# Hello-World
Starting to Git IT
About me: Old nerd that works in IT
Interests: Looking for Code on System Admin/ Engineering
Hopes: To develop apps that make System Administering easier.
Main Focus: An app that would make the Windows update process easier and more intuative.
    - This includes being about to browse  AD and locate servers, the pull up the info on the server. ie: OS Version, and app installed, then be able to drill down and see all updates that are installed for the OS and apps and see all out standing updates available.
    - Being able to create reports from this information. Auditors are always asking for this.
    - Being able to instaall the updates from the app, and see the reboot status of the server.
